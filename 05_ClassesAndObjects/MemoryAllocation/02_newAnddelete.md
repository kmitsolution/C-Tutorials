In C++, `new` and `delete` are operators used for dynamic memory allocation and deallocation, respectively.

1. **`new` Operator**:
   - The `new` operator is used to dynamically allocate memory for a single object or an array of objects on the heap.
   - When you use `new` to allocate memory, it returns a pointer to the allocated memory.
   - Syntax for allocating memory for a single object:
     ```cpp
     Type* ptr = new Type;
     ```
   - Syntax for allocating memory for an array of objects:
     ```cpp
     Type* arr = new Type[size];
     ```
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     int* ptr = new int; // Allocates memory for a single integer
     int* arr = new int[10]; // Allocates memory for an array of 10 integers
     ```

2. **`delete` Operator**:
   - The `delete` operator is used to deallocate memory that was previously allocated with `new`.
   - Syntax for deallocating memory for a single object:
     ```cpp
     delete ptr;
     ```
   - Syntax for deallocating memory for an array of objects:
     ```cpp
     delete[] arr;
     ```
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     delete ptr; // Deallocates memory allocated for a single integer
     delete[] arr; // Deallocates memory allocated for an array of integers
     ```

It's important to note that memory allocated with `new` must be deallocated with `delete`, and memory allocated with `new[]` must be deallocated with `delete[]`. Failing to do so can lead to memory leaks or undefined behavior.

# new and delete opeators for Classes and Objects

In C++, the `new` and `delete` operators are frequently used in conjunction with classes to dynamically allocate and deallocate memory for objects on the heap. Here's how they can be used with classes:

1. **Using `new` to Allocate Memory for Objects**:

   You can use the `new` operator to dynamically allocate memory for objects of a class. This is particularly useful when you want to create objects whose lifetimes are not limited to a specific scope or when you need to manage objects with varying lifetimes.

   Example:
   ```cpp
   class MyClass {
   public:
       MyClass() {
           // Constructor
       }
       // Other member functions and variables
   };

   MyClass* objPtr = new MyClass(); // Dynamically allocate memory for a single object
   ```

2. **Using `delete` to Deallocate Memory**:

   After you're done using dynamically allocated objects, you should free the memory they occupy to prevent memory leaks. The `delete` operator is used to deallocate memory allocated with `new`.

   Example:
   ```cpp
   delete objPtr; // Deallocate memory for the object
   ```

   It's important to note that calling `delete` on a pointer to an object automatically invokes the destructor of that object before deallocating memory. This ensures that any resources held by the object are properly released.

3. **Using `new[]` and `delete[]` for Dynamic Arrays**:

   If you need to dynamically allocate an array of objects of a class, you can use the `new[]` operator to allocate memory for the array and `delete[]` to deallocate it.

   Example:
   ```cpp
   MyClass* objArray = new MyClass[10]; // Dynamically allocate an array of 10 objects
   ```

   To deallocate the array:
   ```cpp
   delete[] objArray; // Deallocate memory for the array of objects
   ```

   Again, calling `delete[]` on a pointer to an array automatically invokes the destructor for each object in the array before deallocating memory.
