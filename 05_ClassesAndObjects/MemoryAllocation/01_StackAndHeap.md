In C++, memory can be broadly categorized into two main types: stack memory and heap memory. Understanding the differences between these two types of memory is crucial for writing efficient and correct C++ code.

1. **Stack Memory**:
   
   - Stack memory is used for storing local variables and function call information.
   - Memory allocation and deallocation on the stack are handled automatically by the compiler.
   - Variables allocated on the stack have automatic storage duration, meaning they are created when the scope containing the declaration is entered and destroyed when the scope is exited.
   - Stack memory is limited and typically smaller compared to heap memory.
   - Access to stack memory is faster than access to heap memory because of its LIFO (Last In, First Out) nature.

   Example:

   ```cpp
   void foo() {
       int x = 10; // x is allocated on the stack
       // ...
   }
   ```

2. **Heap Memory**:

   - Heap memory is used for dynamic memory allocation.
   - Memory allocation and deallocation on the heap are done explicitly by the programmer using operators like `new` and `delete`.
   - Memory allocated on the heap has dynamic storage duration, meaning it persists until explicitly deallocated.
   - Heap memory is typically larger than stack memory, but its allocation and deallocation can be slower.
   - Improper use of heap memory can lead to memory leaks or heap fragmentation.

   Example:

   ```cpp
   int* ptr = new int; // Allocate memory on the heap
   // ...
   delete ptr; // Deallocate memory
   ```

It's important to use stack memory for short-lived variables and heap memory for dynamically allocated data that needs to persist beyond the scope in which it was allocated. Additionally, proper management of heap memory is essential to avoid memory leaks and undefined behavior. Techniques such as smart pointers (`std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr`) and standard library containers (`std::vector`, `std::string`) can help simplify memory management and reduce the risk of memory-related bugs.
