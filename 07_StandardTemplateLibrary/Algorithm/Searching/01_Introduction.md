In C++ STL (Standard Template Library), various algorithms are provided for searching elements in containers like vectors, arrays, lists, etc. Here are some commonly used algorithms for searching:

1. **`std::find()`**:
   - Finds the first occurrence of a value in a range.
2. **`std::binary_search()`**:
   - Checks if a value exists in a sorted range.
3. **`std::count()`**:
   - Counts the occurrences of a value in a range.
4. **`std::search()`**:
   - Finds the first occurrence of a sequence in another sequence.

These are just a few examples of searching algorithms available in C++ STL. Depending on your specific requirements and the data structure you're working with, you can choose the appropriate algorithm.
