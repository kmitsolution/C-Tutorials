C++ was created by <b>Bjarne Stroustrup</b>, a Danish computer scientist, in the early 1980s. Stroustrup was working at Bell Labs, where he wanted to enhance the C programming language with features of Simula (a language supporting object-oriented programming). He aimed to create a language that combined efficiency, low-level hardware access (like C), and high-level abstractions (like Simula).

The development of C++ started as an extension of the C language, called <b>"C with Classes." </b>This extension included features such as classes, derived classes, strong type checking, default arguments, and inline functions.

In 1983, Stroustrup renamed the language from "C with Classes" to C++. The name signifies "incremented C" or "C plus" and symbolizes the evolutionary nature of the language.

Over the years, Stroustrup and a growing community of developers refined and expanded C++. The language underwent standardization efforts to ensure consistency and portability across different platforms. It evolved through various iterations (C++98, C++03, C++11, and so on) introducing new features, improvements, and better programming practices.

C++ gained popularity due to its efficiency, flexibility, and support for various programming paradigms. Its ability to handle low-level operations while providing high-level abstractions contributed to its widespread use in systems programming, application development, game development, and more.
